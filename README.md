# SimpleQueryParser
A simple query parser generated by flex and bison

Introduction
============

This is a simple query parser that recognizes logic queries like:

 - this that     // Parsed as "this AND that"
 - this AND that
 - this AND NOT that
 - this AND NOT (he AND her)

Compile
=======

 - $ mkdir build
 - $ cd build
 - $ cmake ..
 - $ make

Usage
=====

./parser "this AND that"

Warning
=======

This parser is not thread-safe since it uses global variables while parsing.

For those who may want to embed a thread-safe parser into their own application, please see [SimpleQueryParser++](https://github.com/itechbear/SimpleQueryParserPlusPlus)

P.S.
====

This is a toy project. I tried three methods to build a query parser. You can find the other two:

 - [SimpleQueryParserPlusPlus](https://github.com/itechbear/SimpleQueryParserPlusPlus) : A simple query parser generated by flex and bison (C++ Language)
 - [SimpleQueryParserSpirit](https://github.com/itechbear/SimpleQueryParserSpirit) : A simple query parser written in Boost.Spirit (C++ Language)
